    <h2 id="about-title"> WHO ARE WE? </h2>

    <div class="about-store">
        <p> Desi Destination was created by people who miss their parents cooking and their homeland. </p>
        <p>
            It's very comforting to come home after a long day to smell something so good in the kitchen you honestly
            cannot wait to chow down.
        </p>
        <p> But, for people who can't experience that feeling whether they are living abroad or they don't have anybody to cook for them.
            Desi Destination is a place where you can experience it all.
        </p>

    <div class="about-dishes">
        <p id="dish-1">
            Our most famous dish is the biriyani platters; full of rice and your protein of choice: chicken, beef or goat!
        </p>
        <p id="dish-1"> 
            This is defintely one of those dishes that makes you want to get another plate but can't because you're still full from
            that first plate.
        </p>

        <p> ------------- </p>

        <p id="dish-2">
            After a good plate of rice and meat and downing it all with a refreshing can of soda, we recommend kalojam afterwards as a nice
            palette cleanser.
        </p>
        <p id="dish-2"> 
            It's very sweet and juicy, very refreshing and well deserved before the food coma nap you'll take after eating our food!
